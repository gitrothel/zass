a boy was born from a perfume flaw—
amber vial cracked at dawn,
and out he poured, half myth, half con.

He learned to sell his pulse in grams,
to bankers, brides, and velvet scams.
his heart ran tabs, his veins took tips,
he blessed the damned with sugar lips.

One night the cherubs staged a coup,
their arrows laced with uncut rue.
He danced through static, half awake,
a wage-slip saint in a garden of ache.

The roses hissed compliance codes,
the topiary hummed in binary odes,
and a mirror, cracked from divine neglect,
whispered, "love is a data-collect."

He signed his name in looping flame,
a covenant inked in unclaimed shame.
The moon swore silence, the stars withdrew,
and every clause he'd broken came due.

Now rumor says if you breathe too deep
where boxwoods dream and cherubs weep,
you'll smell his ghost—white musk, regret—
and owe him something you can't forget.`

They briefed me in perfume and protocol,
Told me the mission was affection.
Every garden is surveillance,
Every bloom a listening device.
I take notes in pulse rhythms.
Your breath leaks intel.

Pre-Chorus
Touch isn't touch; it's data.
Names mean nothing—timing does.

Chorus
I hunt in the topiary,
Under glass-cut moonlight.
Desire's a weaponized instinct—
And I'm still perfecting aim.

Verse 2
You mistake repetition for tenderness.
I call it conditioning.
Between appointments I recalibrate—
Wipe the memory, keep the method.
They study me for side effects
And call it love.

Bridge
Some nights I dream in static,
Wake speaking passwords in rhyme.
You call it poetry.
I call it recovery time.

Final Chorus
Hunting in the topiary,
Where silence keeps the score.
You want mercy; I want precision.
Either way, someone's paying.

Outro
The roses record everything.
They always have.`

So I rose from petals, eyes half-wired,
A saint in silk, clinically inspired.

I smell your pulse before I see—
obedience smells like ambergris.

[Chorus]
Atomized in the boxwoods deep, where roses wake and secrets sleep.
My bow's a prayer, my heart's a code, a weapon kissed by saints of woe.
Perfume's the key, I am the door—
come closer, love, you'll beg for war.

[Final Chorus]
Atomized in the boxwoods deep,
No god to guard, no soul to keep.
The scent commands, the heart obeys,
A cherub lost in static haze.

My bow still sings; my pulse still lies—
Love dies ornate, and weaponized.`

He calls me "art," I call him "class."

The trick is never to flinch or feel—
Just count the commas, make the moment real.
Dim the light, darling, I'll blur the math.
You be the savior, I'll take the wrath.

All cats look the same in the dark.
Bodies vanish—only credit leaves a mark.
Make me your mirror, your crisis, your art.

They ring the bell.
I salivate.
Not hunger—habit.
The corridors all smell like jasmine and formaldehyde.
I've forgotten which turn leads to exit,
which one loops back to the observation room.

Pre-Chorus
They say: Good boy, Eros. Again.
I don't remember my number anymore.
Just the sequence:
Approach. Seduce. Extract. Repeat.

Chorus
Run the maze, collect the reward.
They time me now—how fast I make you want me.
Pavlov's in the corner taking notes.
I'm the dog. I'm the bell. I'm the drool.`

Three poisoned arrows through your see-through chest,
Glass heart shattering, love undressed.
No mercy, no manners, silk over sin,
Romance wears latex and claws like skin.

[Chorus]
Three poisoned arrows, pulsing blue,
That's how Cupid says, "fuck you."
One for deceit, one for the ache,
One for the boy I learned to break.

[Bridge – delirious, perverse lullaby]
Draw back, breathe in, veins hum,
Write his eulogy on my tongue.
Float the arrows, frame the kill,
Nothing's holy when it stays still.

[Outro – whispered countdown, wet and trembling]
Three…
Two…
One…
Divine.`

*Trim the hedges into deer*
*Everything here used to breathe*
*Now it's just topiary teeth*

Welcome to the garden where the bushes have eyes
Sculpted into swans with their necks asking why
Cupid's in the boxwood with his skull half-gone
The wires in his head hum a nursery song

He learned to count by heartbeats
One two three four
Mama was a goddess
Now she's fertilizer for the floor

In the topiary garden where nothing grows right
The roses have teeth and they bloom at night
MK Baby's hunting with his aim so clean
Sharpest little apex in the evergreen

*Cut you into shapes*
*Pose you where he wants*
*Love's a landscaping project*
*And you're the latest font*`

They focus-grouped my new name.
Said Eros polled too intellectual,
Cupid too precious for the demos they're targeting.
So they Frankenstein it:
Cute + visceral + just gross enough to go viral.
Now I'm an LLC with wings.

Chorus
CUPID ZASS—say it three times in the mirror,
I appear with terms and conditions.
Love as a service, intimacy as a subscription.
Swipe right. I'm the promoted post
in your serotonin feed.

Outro
CUPID ZASS.
Say it until it stops meaning anything.
That's the point.
I'm not a person.
I'm a product placement
in your loneliest hour.`

Careful who you call a god—
She's the architect, not divine
All that glitters in her garden
Is surveillance by design

She was Venus in the briefing
She was Mother in the lab
Don't mistake her for salvation—
She's the one who made me stab

[Chorus: Transmission to Next Subject]
Watch the poisoned arrows
(She taught me how to aim)
Watch her honeyed tongue
(She named me, then erased my name)
Watch your mouth—
Don't let her make you what I've become

[Bridge: Cupid Breaking Protocol]
I was seventeen when she recruited me
Said "You'll be desire itself"
Now I'm thirty-three surveillance tapes deep
And I can't feel anything but the task

Don't call her god.
She's just the first one who learned how to—
